# HR Analytics Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project focuses on developing an **HR Analytics Dashboard** using real-world data to analyze employee attendance patterns over three months. The goal was to process raw attendance data, extract meaningful insights, and visualize key HR metrics using **Power BI**.  

## Data Processing & Transformation  
1. **Data Cleaning & Integration**:  
   - The dataset was sourced from three separate Excel sheets, each containing attendance records for different months.  
   - I cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues.  
   - The three datasets were merged into a continuous, structured format to facilitate seamless analysis.  

2. **Feature Engineering & Metrics Calculation**:  
   - Derived key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to HR analytics, including:  
     - **Presence Percentage (%)** – The proportion of days an employee was physically present.  
     - **Work From Home Percentage (WFH%)** – The share of remote working days.  
     - **Sick Leave Percentage (SL%)** – The percentage of sick leave taken.  
   - Additional factors such as holidays, half-days, and partial work-from-home scenarios were also considered to ensure accurate calculations.  

## Dashboard Development  
- Developed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize and present insights effectively.  
- The dashboard provides HR teams with a **comprehensive view** of workforce attendance trends, helping in decision-making and workforce management.  
- Key features include:  
  - **Trend Analysis** – Monthly variations in attendance patterns.  
  - **Comparative Insights** – Employee-wise and department-wise breakdowns.  
  - **Interactive Filters** – Enables users to analyze data dynamically based on selected time frames or employee categories.  

### Technologies Used  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation  
- **Python / Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing (if applicable)  
- **SQL (if applicable)** – Data manipulation and querying
